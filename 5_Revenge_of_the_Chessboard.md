Ah yes, like M. Night Shyamalan movies and the flu, the Chessboard assignment was inflicted upon us again this week. And this time...IT WAS BACK WITH A VENGEANCE.

Working through the logic became a little easier. It felt like I knew what needed to be done, but much like last week I had no idea how to actually do it.

So I decided that the only thing that could defeat this great evil was something just as vile and horrid...<strong>MATH</strong>. 

I used things like `math.floor` & `%` to create a shorthand for my moves, which received a humored chuckle from David. I determined that that either meant I did something really cool or really weird. Which ever it may be, I took it as a small victory.

I didn't get to go to the rooftop as much last week either due to Hurrican Joaquin making his appearance in Durham. BUT I did receive a couple of indoor signs instead.
