## THREE WEEKS DOWN! 

We are almost a third of the way done with this cohort, and the pressure is definitely felt. At this point I can't say I even know what to anticipate what I'll be capable of doing in the coming two months. 

One thing I am certain about though is that it will be challenging. With each new assignment I struggle against my Imposter Syndrome more and more. And sometimes looking at every little checkbox left empty feels like adding a 10ft wall between myself and the finish line. 

But I keep moving. I have started incorporating more research into my work flow. And luckily my fellow Future Front-End Engineers (try to say that five times fast) often share their resources via `slack` as well! I feel like together we're definitely growing day by day. 

I really enjoy how we're getting into code that can translate into applicable job skills. It's definitely helping me visualize turning this into a career a little bit more.
