## THREE WEEKS DOWN! 

We are almost a third of the way done with this cohort, and the pressure is definitely felt. At this point I can't say I even know what to anticipate what I'll be capable of doing in the coming two months. 

One thing I am certain about though is that it will be challenging. With each new assignment I struggle against my Imposter Syndrome more and more. And sometimes looking at every little checkbox left empty feels like adding a 10ft wall between myself and the finish line. 

But I keep moving. I have started incorporating more research into my work flow. And luckily my fellow Future Front-End Engineers (try to say that five times fast) often share their resources via `slack` as well! I feel like together we're definitely growing day by day. 

I really enjoy how we're getting into code that can translate into applicable job skills. It's definitely helping me visualize turning this into a career a little bit more. And incorporating more complex CSS has been...interesting. Seeing what you can do with the basics given to us through Codecademy has really helped strength my understanding of Cascading Style Sheets. 

Something I'd like to learn more about is how to make fun little animations on websites. We've gotten to work with NestedAccordion's rotating arrows, and that got me wondering what else we're able to achieve. 

But first I need to improve my limited JavaScript skills....
