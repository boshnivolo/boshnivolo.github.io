Made it to Week 3! First off: woo-hoo!

This week has challenged my understanding of how to turn English into JavaScript. And while they don't seem to have that option on Google translate, I've been able to piece together the general structure of JavaScript syntax through Mozilla references, past assignments, and pure dumb luck. 

That being said, there's a point in the coding where luck just won't cut it. One of which being when I'm at a loss of what function should be used, what the parameters are, the arguments necessary to make it a work piece of JavaScript. 
Sometimes I feel like I'm not Java-<em>equipped</em> for Java<em>Script</em>. <em>Ba-dum-tch!</em>

But, bad puns aside, there's still a lot I need to learn. To work on that I've been using the Mozilla Developer website for references on different objects, descripters, operators, etc. 

I've also noticed that we as a class have gotten better at working together on difficult assignments, and as a result we've been able to combine our relative knowledge of certain things into one big (sometimes) working code! This may be one of the most significant achievements we've unlocked in our first three weeks since it's not only applicable to our future careers, but our lives as well. This also seems to tie into our pair-programming where we work through similiar problems together in turns and see the varying results we reach.  

And scoping in JavaScript seems to be like using sonar to figure out what should be there by seeing what bounces back...or something. So in that regard `var` and `function()` maps out what bounced back. And as the begin sending out more tests to search the deep depths of JavaScript for any sign of life, I get a better understanding of the strange functions and side-effects that inhabit my code.
