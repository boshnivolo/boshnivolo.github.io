Week 3. First off: woo-hoo!

This week has challenged my understanding of how to turn English into JavaScript. And while they don't seem to have that option on Google translate, I've been able to piece together the general structure of JavaScript syntax through Mozilla references, past assignments, and pure dumb luck. 

That being said, there's a point in the coding where luck just won't cut it. One of which being when I'm at a loss of what function should be used, what the parameters are, the arguments necessary to make it a work piece of JavaScript. 
Sometimes I feel like I'm not Java-<em>equipped</em> for Java<em>Script</em>. <em>Ba-dum-tch!</em>

But, bad puns aside, there's still a lot I need to learn. To work on that I've been using the Mozilla Developer website for references on different objects, descripters, operators, etc. 

And scoping in JavaScript seems to be like using sonar to figure out what should be there by seeing what bounces back...or something. So in that regard `var` and `function()` maps out what bounced back. 

Pair-programming. Did a bit of that. Kind of. We worked in groups.
