### How To: User Stories

So let's say you've got a big project you gotta tackle. You need some full-scale working code that does exactly what someone else asks you to make it do with multiple processes and moving icons, specific click actions, self-embedding images; basically all the bells and whistles. Feeling panicked yet? 

Well, before you jump ship and fall into a downward spiral of self-pity and Hot Pockets, breathe. Because although the project seems daunting, there's a way to lay out the groundwork. How, you may ask? Two words.

#### User Stories!

Yes, User Stories, those code comments crammed into JavaScript files across the world.
