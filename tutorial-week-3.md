### How To: User Stories

So let's say you've got a big project you gotta tackle. You need some full-scale working code that does exactly what someone else asks you to make it do with multiple processes and moving icons, specific click actions, self-embedding images; basically all the bells and whistles. Feeling panicked yet? 

Well, before you jump ship and fall into a downward spiral of self-pity and Hot Pockets, breathe. Because although the project seems daunting, there's a way to lay out the groundwork. How, you may ask? Two words.

#### User Stories!

Yes, User Stories, those code comments crammed into JavaScript files across the world. 

But those can be intimidating all on their own, right? Wrong. All you need is a smurf!

```
"A smurf can smurf so a smurf can smurf better."
```

Though this quote may sound like nonsense, there's a hidden gem in all that noise. 



##### Example

```
`// A user can type into a text area and the site will log their input.
