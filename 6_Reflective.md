### 6 WEEKS DONE

Week 6 meant the end of the first half of this cohort...and it was bittersweet. While these past weeks have flown by,
I still feel like I am a bumbling toddler trying to navigate the unfamiliar corners of the upright coding world. 
Every so often I'll manage to balance myself on my weak lil' baby legs, maybe take a single step, but in no time at all the assignments will come knock me on my ass once again. 

Last week we were situated in the eye of the hurricane. We were given new Blueprints that tested our patience with CSS and allowed us to review our HTML skills. I actually enjoyed a lot of it since it made concepts like `position` and `display` more concrete in my mind. 

So. Much. SKITCHING. (STILL. SO. MUCH. SKITCHING.) But the concept and practical application for it is clear. I definitely see it being a necessary process for big projects I'll have to work on soon enough. 

And that's another thing I've been spending a lot of time thinking about recently. What kind of projects will I be working on once I get a job. How will I be able to problem-solve without the instruction of my peers and teachers? Will I be able to overcome my uncertainty towards my own ability? 

I think about these things a lot...but it only ever makes me feel more determined to make it work. It fills me with the feeling you get before you get on a roller coaster or have to perform an unrehearsed lip-sync routine in front of a crowd of people you don't know. This feeling has never stopped me before, so I see no reason for it to stop me now. And if I get scared, or even if I embarrass myself, it'll still be better than never trying it and missing out on a good story.
