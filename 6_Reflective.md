### 6 WEEKS DONE

Week 6 meant the end of the first half of this cohort...and it was bittersweet. While these past weeks have flown by,
I still feel like I am a bumbling toddler trying to navigate the unfamiliar corners of the upright coding world. 
Every so often I'll manage to balance myself on my weak lil' baby legs, maybe take a single step, but in no time at all the assignments will come knock me on my ass once again. 

Last week we were situated in the eye of the hurricane. We were given new Blueprints that tested our patience with CSS and allowed us to review our HTML skills. I actually enjoyed a lot of it since it made concepts like `position` and `display` more concrete in my mind. 

So. Much. SKITCHING. (STILL. SO. MUCH. SKITCHING.)
