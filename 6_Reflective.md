### 6 WEEKS DONE

Week 6 meant the end of the first half of this cohort...and it was bittersweet. While these past weeks have flown by,
I still feel like I am a bumbling toddler trying to navigate the unfamiliar corners of the upright coding world. 

Last week we were situated in the eye of the hurricane. We were given new Blueprints that tested our patience with CSS
and allowed us to review our HTML skills.

So. Much. SKITCHING.
