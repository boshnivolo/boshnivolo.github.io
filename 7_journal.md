Merging is very hard to do when you have 12 people trying to merge into the same place. I imagine it's like me 
trying to park in a tiny parking garage, but the guy behind me wants the same spot so we just do an awkward tango 
until eventually neither one of us gets the spot & we go home. 

My group was great though. I bought pizza for my team when I was team lead. I'm pretty sure I was the best team lead. Ever.

We also went over some angular and how that may apply to a website like Etsy.
