Wow, we've already finished up our 4th week here at the Iron Yard! Man, am I feeling the pressure. 

With a third of our time here already past us, the incessant reminder of how short 3 months really is has been plaguing me. The fear that I'm going to find myself in week 12 just as clueless as I am now has lead me to seek a reprieve at the roof of the parking garage every day. Up there I seek a sort of sign from the downtown Durham cityscape that I can not only survive the coming weeks, but conquer them. So far I've only received a very nonchalant pigeon landing beside me and a discarded paper bag from Moe's as an answer. I'm not sure what they mean, but I took them as positive responses from the universe. 

Overcoming week three was like running a 5K with no prior training. It left my mind a little sore, but still willing for more activity. It was all new terrain but at least there was a steady pace. 

Week four, however, was like putting my mind through a Triathlon. A triathlon in which I sprain my ankle in the first 5 minutes. 

But the one plus to that is that week 5's yak-shaving assignments feel like precious moments of relief on the stretcher as the paramedics wisk me away. 

Tired analogies aside, there are still many things I do not understand about JavaScript. The larger concepts of the logic are starting to come together in my mind, but actually turning those into working code is where my brain stops short. I've increased my research time in order to compensate for that, and I've started asking more questions too when I'm lost. Thanks to that I've regained some determination over the weekend. I'm not willing to give up.

Because there are going to be moments where I face 5K's and moments where I'm fighting through a triathlon. There are going to be times where I'm pushing through a mental sprain, lying out on a yak-shaving stretcher, or standing next to someone's Toyota Corolla on the roof of the Blackwell parking lot searching for a Sass savior. But sprains will heal. And code will become more coherent. And I will always take apathetic pigeons and abandoned lunch bags as good signs. 

Especially when we're dealing with challenges in life, it's important to take every experience as a positive one, because we can't ever change the past, but it can sure as hell change us.
