Wow, we've already finished up our 4th week here at the Iron Yard! Man, am I feeling the pressure. 

With a third of our time here already past us, the incessant reminder of how short 3 months really is has been plaguing me. The fear that I'm going to find myself in week 12 just as clueless as I am now has lead me to seek a reprieve at the roof of the parking garage every day. Up there I seek a sort of sign from the downtown Durham cityscape that I can not only survive the coming weeks, but conquer them. So far I've only received a very nonchalant pigeon landing beside me and a discarded paper bag from Moe's as an answer. I'm not sure what they mean, but I took them as positive responses from the universe. 

Overcoming week three was like running a 5K with no prior training. It left my mind a little sore, but still willing for more activity. 

Week four, however, was like putting my mind through a Triathlon. A triathlon in which I sprain my ankle in the first 5 minutes.
