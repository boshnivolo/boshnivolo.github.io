According to Dr. Carol Dweck, psychologist and author of the book _Mindset_, there are two fundamental mindsets. The first being a growth mindset. This is when an individual sees their abilities as an evolving quality able to improve when focused and worked on. This one is perferred. The other is a fixed mindset. Makes a person believe they are given a set amount of talent or intelligence. Makes them try less and not focus on improvement. Creates a sense of inescapeable inadequacy. Sees failure as a final result rather than a chance to learn from one's mistakes. 

One instance of when I executed a growth mindset is when I started drawing. Started out making really bad anime style drawings. Started gaining inspiration from various art types. Kept drawing everyday in order to improve. Took art electives during school. Looked up tutorials when a certain medium of art gave me trouble. Saw my ability to do art as an evolving trait. 

Differnt instance I had a fixed mindset. Got a job as a waitress at an upscale restaurant. Had difficulty keeping up with all the little rules that were enforced. Had trouble visualizing which side of the table I would be facing which would determine which arm I'd hold the plate in order to serve open-handed while keeping light conversation, but at the same time not bother the guests. Felt like it was something I could not handle as it was my first server job. Got frustrated. Quit. I believed that I could not improve as a server so I did not try to put in more time mastering the art of fancy wine-opening. Fixed mindset. 

I will apply to TIY by practicing as much as I can. Instead of getting frustrated I'll just research what I don't understand from various sources. Will pace myself while increasing my workload in order to see myself improve.
