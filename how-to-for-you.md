### THIS WEEK: HOW TO...WRITE A REALLY GOOD TUTORIAL!

Hello again! Welcome to my tutorial! 

<h4>STEP 1:</h4> INTRODUCTION! It's important to make your tutorial structured in such a way that someone without a coding background could at least follow along with it. This is where a short introduction can be really useful. Give a short description of the different elements that will be used in your steps. That way your readers will have a point of reference for what to use in order to accomplish the task at hand. 

<h4>STEP 2:</h4> NUMBERED LISTS! These bullets can work as small, manageable steps that your readers can follow along with. It also gives you a good way to organize your elaborations of the steps so the person reading can have an easier time backtracking to previous steps in case they make a mistake farther down the list. 

<h4>STEP 3:</h4> PICTURES!

Though not always necessary, images can help your audience have a visual reference to what you are trying to explain. This not only makes the concept clearer in some cases, but also aids in retaining the information given during your tutorial. 

<h4>STEP 4:</h4> EMPHASIS! In technical tutorials pertaining to code, utilizing code fences help to make important text (such as commands, elements, tags, functions, etc) stand out against the rest of the words. 

For example: 
```
var standOut = (``` + ' ' + ```)
```
This helps your readers make the distinction between your explaination and the code they may need to input.

<h4>STEP 5:</h4> PROOFREAD! 

(Also, small note to Kelly, who has to read this: I don't think I should teach anybody anything because every time I do you end up with thousands of commits from node_modules and sudo disasters. Just saying....)
