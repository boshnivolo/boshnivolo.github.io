### How to...Set Up Columns!!

How many you want? 1? 2? 3?? **20???**

I GOT YOU. 

FIRST...GET YOU SOME HTML.

_**Ingredients**_

* `<main>`s for your containers! Add a class too. It'll make your SASS soooo much easier. 
* `<section>`s work too! 


* ALLERGY WARNING: `<div>`s! DON'T USE THEM! 
###### Unless there's nothing else.

NEXT...GET YOU SOME SASS ON THAT.

Put those class names to work! Be as specific as possible! 

FINALLY...`float`!!!!
