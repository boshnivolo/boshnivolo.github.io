## Front End Lecture
### _Week 1_

 <strong>"It's kind of like drowning kittens. You guys are like kittens and we're throwing you into the water, but you'll learn how to swim soon." - The Front End Instructors</strong>
 
 72 hours. That's approximately the amount of time I've spent coding in the first week here at the Iron Yard. Compared to the 25 hours of sleep I've had in the same week, 72 hours sounds like a lot. It sounds daunting even. And yet, day after day I've struggled with getting the bare minimum down and running tests in JavaScript that work, let alone pass. 
 
 It's...frustrating, to say the least. 
 
 But at the same time, I'm amazed at what I HAVE managed to learn too. I learned how to use 'if, else' statements, set up 'mocha chai', create tests, and so much more! It might not seem like much now, but author Malcolm Gladwell once wrote that it takes roughly ten thousand hours of practice to achieve mastery in a field. Ten thousand! Suddenly, those 72 hours don't seem so big. 
 
 So whenever I feel completely lost, and I'm looking at JavaScript like it's Russian, I'll take a moment to remember that 72 hours is less than 1% of 10,000. It'll still be difficult, and I'll still get frustrated, but I won't stop working towards achieving mastery.
 
 I'll learn how to swim.
