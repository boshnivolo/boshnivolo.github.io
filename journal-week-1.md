Wonderful World of JavaScript

* Perform operations with the values you can represent. 

* Expressions is anything you can value. Simplest expression is null. Result of an operation. 

* Function Invocation: leave out spaces. Spaces are for humans.

* Concatenation: the operation of joining two strings together. “+”

* Javascript will remove unlabeled functions in order to conserve memory

* var label = “one”; (var label is assigned single equals string o n e)

* operators: =, +, ==

* operands: one on the left, one on the right

What are the 4 primitive types?
1. Null
  * Intentionally empties a value 
2. Boolean (“true” or “false”)
  * Zero is always false
  * All numbers that are NOT zero are always true
  * Null is always false
3. Number
  * Must be Camel-cased
4. Strings (delimiters needed to differentiate words versus commands)

REPL - READ, EVALUATE, PRINT, LOOP

Single quotes, Double quotes, Curly quotes

Single quotes requires a backslash to cancel out special characters in cases of apostrophe

Boolean text coercion takes a string and coerces it to be either true or false

If the length of the string is zero it’s false 

What are the 2 container types?
* Array
   *List —>(list[1, 2, 3])
* Items

What 3 things does a function have?
* Input
* Output
* Side-Effects

How can I execute a JS file?

What is Control Flow?

How do I alter it?

How can I draw it?

What is Pair Programming?

What is Text-Driven Development?

How is Programming like the Martial Arts? 
* Build muscle memory through practice. Like kicking practice in Tae Kwon Doe. Work it out in front of other people where everybody can see you so they can see what you’re doing wrong. The “dojo”.
