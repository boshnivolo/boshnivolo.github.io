I always end up understanding the HW assignment the day after it is due. Which is very frustrating. But I've learned from my little alcoholic lunch excursion that drinking a little bit helps the work go by. It also makes me sleepy though. And this couch is really comfortable. 

In order to lower the amount of unproductive behavior I've begun taking breaks from my coding work with other types of work. Like "laundry break", "workout break", "creative writing break", etc. That way I can manage to do more with a day than I normally would when I have nothing to do.
