### How To: User Stories

So let's say you've got a big project you gotta tackle. You need some full-scale working code that does exactly what someone else asks you to make it do with multiple processes and moving icons, specific click actions, self-embedding images; basically all the bells and whistles. Feeling panicked yet? 

Well, before you jump ship and fall into a downward spiral of self-pity and Hot Pockets, breathe. Because although the project seems daunting, there's a way to lay out the groundwork. How, you may ask? Two words.

#### User Stories!

Yes, User Stories, those code comments crammed into JavaScript files across the world. 

But those can be intimidating all on their own, right? Wrong. All you need is a smurf!

```
"A smurf can smurf so a smurf can smurf better."
```

Though this quote may sound like nonsense, there's a hidden gem in all that noise. 



##### Example

```
`// A user can type into a text area and the site will log their input.
 // The text area will be selected by the user by clicking in the space within the rectangle.
 // The user will begin typing upon selecting the text area.
 // When the user is done typing, the user will click a 'SUBMIT' button located below the text area. 
 // Upon clicking the button, the information added to the text area will be logged into the site's data. 
 // If nothing has been added to the text area, the screen will issue a message asking the user to add some data. 
```

Through this format, the person looking over your code will have a clear look into what you want the experience to be like for the user. This will help structure the code better and aid in insuring that the functionality matches up with your plan.
